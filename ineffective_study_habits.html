<p>Ineffective study habits is a barrier for many students and adults, it can be whether they have distractions, procrastinations, cramming, or the lack of amount of sleep they get etc. 
This website will allow students and adults to figure out what ineffective study habits they have and what solutions will allow them to fix their ineffective habits and turn them into effective study habits.</p>
<h3>LIST OF INEFFECTIVE STUDY HABITS:</h3>
<h3> - Studying without a plan: When studying without a plan there will be a lack of direction which will cause students and adults to find it difficult to cover all their subjects and work 
    within the limited amount of time they have.</h3>
<h3> - Cramming: Many people decide to leave their work til last minute, which can affect them badly, causing them to study everything before the due date.</h3>
<h3> - Distractions: It is very common for people to get distracted whenever it comes to studying due to social media, family, and friends, this habit can affect people to delay their studies and become behind in 
       classes.</h3> 
<h3> - Studying when you're tired: Studing without having enough sleep is inefficient, you will not be able to focus as much and remember notes while studying. Therefore, it is important that you ensure that you have had
       had enough sleep and rest, that way when you have enough energy you will be able to stay productive when studying. Another important thing to look out for is when you have had enough sleep and you are very energized then
       can try studying a bit during that time.</h3>
<h3> - Multitasking: Multitasking is a common thing for many people, they tend to focus on more than one subject during the limited amount of time they have. A solution for this is to divide your work and pay attention to the subject 
       that you find more difficult and then shift your attention to other subjects once you have finished and it is also recommended to leave the subject you find the least difficult for last, almost like a treat.</h3>
<h3> - Not asking for help when you need it: Many people are afraid to ask help from teachers or peers when in need of assistance. Without asking for assistance this will not help when it comes to studying due to the lack of knowledge
       you have. It is important that you correct this bad habit as it wont only help improve your grades but will also allow you to overcome that fear and improve your quality of life.</h3>
<h3> - Having notes everywhere: This is a main bad habit that people have, having notes placed everywhere will not be helpful as it will be difficult for you to find notes for a certain subject as it is piled up with every other subject 
       notes. Additionally, this will cause some people to panick as they may have only one copy and have not memorised what was on it or some may have to rewrite their notes which causes them to delay their studies. Therefore
       it is important to prioritise having a neat work space where it is easy for you to find notes for a specific subject.</h3>
<h3>LIST OF SOLUTIONS FOR INEFFECTIVE STUDY HABITS:</h3>
<h3> - Distractions: A solution that will help poeple study without becoming distracted is to either place their phone in a different room where it is nowhere to be seen
       or you could either study in a quiet area such as the library, that way there are no distractions and if family is one of the distractions then it is recommended
       to study at a library where there is silence and no distractions, allowing you to focus and study everything you need to catch up on or any work.</h3>
