  <h3>Ineffective study habits are the things that stop people from learning and succeeding.
       Ineffective study habits occur for many reasons such as distractions due to social media, 
       lack of motivation, no routine or study plan, multitasking and procrastination etc. Another 
       main reason ineffective study habits may occur is due to the lack of knowledge of not understanding 
       how to study or what to study, it may also be because of the amount of work being set to 
       students and adults which causes them to stress. It is important that these ineffective study 
       habits are addressed and helpful so that students and adults are able to effectively learn without 
       any barriers holding them back.</h3>
